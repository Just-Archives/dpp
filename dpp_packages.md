# Importable packages
- To use certain functions, you need to import standard built-in packages into your code. For example - to use `cout`, you need to have a `console` package imported. Below, you can find the full list of available packages.

## Package `console`

### `cout`

```pawn
using::console.cout,"some words.";
```
