# Project management

- `config.dppproj` is called the project file. You can use the project file to setup your project environment, such as the project name, components your project is using and way more.

Below is the list of project settings:

## `project_name`

```ini
project_name=MY NEW PROJECT
```

## `stack_output`

```ini
stack_output=true
```

```ini
stack_output=false
```
