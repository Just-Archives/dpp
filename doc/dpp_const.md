# Constants
- In computer programming, a constant is a value that should not be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant.

- You also may make constants in D++:

```cpp
const*new.int,MY_FIRST_CONST=1;
```


You also may create boolean and string constants:

```cpp
const*new.bool,MY_FIRST_CONST=true;

const*new.str,MY_FIRST_CONST="string";
```

## Data types

### `int`

- Integers are whole numbers.

```cpp
const*new.int,integer=1;
```

### `bool`

- Booleans are variables that can either be true or false.

```cpp
const*new.bool,boolean=true;
```

### `str`

- Strings are words or sequences of characters.

```cpp
const*new.str,string="test";
```

### `double`

- Doubles are numbers with decimal points.

```cpp
const*new.double,decimal_point=3.14;
```

### `char`

- Single characters.

```cpp
const*new.char,character='6';
```
