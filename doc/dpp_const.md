# Constants
- In computer programming, a constant is a value that should not be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant.

- You also may make constants in D++:

```pawn
const*new.int,MY_FIRST_CONST=1;
```


You also may create boolean and string constants:

```pawn
const*new.bool,MY_FIRST_CONST=true;

const*new.str,MY_FIRST_CONST="string";
```
