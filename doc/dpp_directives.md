# Directives

- The preprocessors are the directives, which give instructions to the compiler to preprocess the information before actual compilation starts. But, since D++ is an interpreted language and does not have an ACTUAL compiler, directives here are just special operations that use different syntax to differ from other features.

## `#include`

- Used to include a file:

```pawn
#include:file;
```

## `#undef`

- Used to undefine a symbol; that can be an iterator, variable, constant or whatever.

```pawn
#undef:var;
```

Example:

```pawn
new.int,undeftest=1;

if.equ,defined?undeftest,1->console.println.log("undeftest is defined");

#undef:undeftest;

if.equ,defined?undeftest,1->console.println.log("undeftest is defined *(again!*)");
```

Output:

```
undeftest is defined
```

## `#pragma`
