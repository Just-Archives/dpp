  The Simplest Multi-purpose Programming Language
</h3>

## Introduction
:zap: Â¤ D++ is a simple scripting language written in Pawn. It is made purely for fun and with an intention to learn more about Pawn itself, thus D++ should not be taken as a serious language. However, the language itself is still impressive considering it is written in Pawn.

- For the impatient, here is the example code:
```pawn
import::package.console;
import::package.system;

using::system.rem,"Basic cout example.";
using::console.cout,"Hello World";
```

- Code output:

```
