## Introduction
:computer: Â¤ D++ is a small interpreted language written in Pawn. It is designed with the role of enabling modification of the gamemode code on the server during run-time. It contains various features and things that aren't even introduced into Pawn itself. D++ has a very complex syntax which makes it very hard to learn but also fragile to small mistakes.


> :paperclip: It is made purely for fun and with an intention to learn more about Pawn itself, thus D++ should not be taken as a serious language. However, the language itself is still impressive considering it is written in Pawn.
